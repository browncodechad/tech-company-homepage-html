            <p>This is our latest release, and it has made history. It's the most sold phone within the last 6 months and also the most sold phone in history. It's also the best phone released this year! It has features that blow our competition out of the water. So lets talk about how we made that happen.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>First off, the <b>Processor</b>. The previous model we released which was the Ultra 14 had the F14 chip in it, however this year the 15 comes with the F16 Pro! Which is 2 generations ahead of the previous chip, and also the top of the line. Its 4.3x faster than the previous model. Which is a very big leap and a strong step ahead towards the future.</li>
            <li>
                <dl>Then, the <b>battery</b>. We heard you, all the complaints that "If the ultra 14 had a better battery it'd be the perfect phone" "It heats up a bit too much" "They never listen to us!", we looked at all of that. And we're excited to announce that the 15 comes with a way bigger and stronger battery. We're talking twice the battery timings, so unlike the 14, this one lasts 2 days, and then a whole 12 hours more! To deal with the heating issues, we put our engineers to work, and we designed a new solution. <b>NeoCooling</b>. Unlike any smartphone you've seen before, we took the initiative and made a bold decision.
                <dd><b>NeoCooling</b> works like a water cooling system, but on a smaller scale. There's a very small pipe in the hardware which has an extremely cold liquid gel (which is transparent like water but very thick and a bit goo-ey) that flows alongside the CPU and battery, and to keep the gel cool, there's a small fan inside the phone which is directly pointed at that pipeline. And to keep the fan cool, that pipe flows through the fan's frame as well. And is it loud? Quite the opposite, its sound is barely noticeable. The pipe is strong enough to not burst, tear open or melt due to the constant conditions it'll be in, bcz it's locked in place and there's a small transparent lid on top of it to prevent any damage to the system in case the worst case scenario happens and the gel starts leaking. But to prevent that, we've carefully manufactured a small rubber pipe thats the perfect length for each device. So its not too tight or too loose. It wont burst open under pressure or loosen up and fall out.</dd></dl>
            </li>
            <li>The 15 now starts with 12 GB of <b>RAM</b> in it's lowest spec compared to the 6 GBs in the 14. It is way more efficient at handling multitasking or heavier work. The highest spec can have a RAM of 24 GB!</li>
            <li>It also has way more storage this time, we're talking 512 GB of <b>ROM</b> in the lowest spec. The highest spec can go upto 2 TB. It's also the latest generation of storage so you will experience absolutely zero lag while navigating through your storage.</li>            
            <li>The latest 15 has a much sharper, detail-oriented and high pixel <b>camera</b>. If you compare it's camera to the previous model, you'll definetly notice that the 15's results are less grainier and way sharper. And if you zoom in you'll see the magic of our zoom optimization, which helps the camera take high quality pictures at great distances. Even if you take a picture at a normal distance, the zoom optimization will make sure that the pixels of that picture are sharper and more detailed.</li>
            <li>And finally, the <b>price</b>. Our business ideology isn't to hoard as much wealth as possible, we're a bunch of dudes who like tech and science just letting their creativity out by innovation. So our devices aren't priced super high, rather they're moderately priced. The previous model was priced at $399.99 at its release and the 15 will be priced at $599.99. Just a $200 jump.</li>

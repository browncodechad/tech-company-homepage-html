This was my first big project using just HTML. I practiced all of the concepts I've learnt so far and I can confidently say I'll be able to recreate this from memory now except for a few things like adding background images/videos, and I definetly need to practice more debugging. I didnt outsource any of it to AI, it was just a tiring task to look at everything all over again to find any bugs, but I pushed through that, and sure enough I did find some and fixed them. I feel a good sense of accomplishment now in what I've done but I also know this is merely scratching the surface of what's to come next. 

Another thing I'd like to add is that I'm finally gonna escape VS Code now and switch to Pheonix Code, because I really liked its UI more than VS Code and when I opened this code in Pheonix, it showed like 20 different errors that VS Code didnt. And that made me realise that VS Code is spoiling me and it wont let me be a better programmer.
